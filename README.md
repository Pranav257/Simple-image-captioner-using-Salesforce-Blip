# BLIP Image Captioning Project

This project utilizes the BLIP (Bootstrapped Language Image Pretraining) model for image captioning. The model is specifically designed to generate captions that are contextually relevant to the images.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- pip

### Dependencies

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
pip install transformers
pip install pillow
pip install requests
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd your-project-directory
```

### Model Setup

Download the BLIP model from Hugging Face:

```python
from transformers import BlipProcessor, BlipForConditionalGeneration

processor = BlipProcessor.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large")
model = BlipForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large").to("cpu")
```

## Usage

To use the model to caption your images, follow these steps:

1. Place your image in the designated folder.
2. Update the `local_image_path` in the script to reflect the location of your image.
3. Run the script to see the generated caption:

```bash
python image_captioning.py
```

Replace `image_captioning.py` with the name of your Python script.

## Example

To caption an image named `1.png` located in the `content` directory:

```bash
python image_captioning.py
```

The script will output the caption generated by the BLIP model.
